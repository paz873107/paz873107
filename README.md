### Hi! 👋 My name is Paz and I'm a software developer in the making

🌱 Looking out for new challenges to keep learning and growing in the IT world. Passionate about detail and visual harmony. Obsessed with CSS.
⚡ When not coding, you can find me singing or spending time with my kittens 🐱🐱.
💬 If you are looking for advice on how to begin your path as a developer, you can reach out for me on Linkedin. I will be posting about my personal experience and reviewing some coding exercises to share with you all.
